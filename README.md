# Automation-OrderTakingTerminal
The 'Automation-OrderTakingTerminal' project consists of two designs: "Automation" and "Order Taking Terminal" device design. The purpose of the "Automation" is to record orders, track orders, generate invoices, and store employee information, among other features. The purpose of the "Order Taking Terminal" device is to inform the automation system about customer orders.

The "Automation" software is written in the C# programming language. Interface designs can be found in the 'Outputs' folder in image format within the repository.

The "Order Taking Terminal" device communicates with the automation software via a USB cable. It consists of LCD screen and Keypad electronic components connected to an Arduino development kit. Connection diagrams for Arduino and other components can be found in the 'ArduinoConnectionDiagrams' folder as images. The Arduino software is located in the 'ArduinoSoftware' folder. To compile the Arduino software, the standard Keypad library must be downloaded from the Arduino IDE.

A simple, understandable, and beautiful project where electronics and software come together.
