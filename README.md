# Automation-OrderTakingTerminal
The "Automation-OrderTakingTerminal" project consists of two designs: "Automation" and "Order Taking Terminal" device design. 
The purpose of the "Automation" software is to record orders, track orders, generate invoices, and store employee information, among other features. 
The purpose of the "Order Taking Terminal" device is to collect orders from customers and transmit the gathered data to the "Automation" software.

"Automation" Software:

The software has features such as recording orders, tracking orders, generating invoices, and storing employee information.

Programming Language: C# Programming Language

Framework: .NET Framework 4.6.1

IDE: Visual Studio 2019

Outputs: The interface designs can be found in the 'Outputs' folder in image.

"Order Taking Terminal" Device And Software:

The "Order Taking Terminal" device connects to the Automation system via USB. The "Order Taking Terminal" device uses an Arduino. 
The Arduino development board is connected to electronic components such as an LCD screen and a keypad.

Software: The Arduino software is located in the 'ArduinoSoftware' folder.

Programming Language: C/C++ Programming Language

IDE: Arduino IDE Version - 2.2.0

Arduino Used: Arduino Uno

Arduino Libraries: To use the Keypad module, the standard Keypad library must be downloaded from the Arduino IDE.

Arduino Connection Diagram: The connection diagrams for Arduino and other components can be found as images in the 'ArduinoConnectionDiagrams' folder.

It is a simple, understandable, and well-designed project where electronics and software come together.
